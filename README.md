## 🔧 Detailed Fixes (with Code Changes)

### 1. BrowserRouter Added
**File:** `src/main.jsx`  
**Problem:** Routes didn't work because Router was missing.  
**Fix:** Wrapped `<App />` inside `<BrowserRouter>`.

```jsx
// After fix
import { StrictMode } from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'
import App from './App.jsx'
import './index.css'

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <App />
    </BrowserRouter>
  </StrictMode>,
)
